🚀 Title: RAG Powered by Groq: Building an AI App That Talks Smart With Your Documents
📄 Post / Article Content:

    In a world where AI-generated answers are only as smart as their context, I decided to build something better — a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that truly knows what it's talking about.

    📚 I created a system that reads through documents, splits them intelligently, stores them in a vector database using state-of-the-art embeddings from HuggingFace, and then — when you ask a question — it retrieves the most relevant chunks and sends them to Groq's Mixtral-8x7B model to answer smartly and precisely.

    🧠 Behind the scenes:

        🤖 Embeddings via HuggingFace BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5

        💽 Vector storage using FAISS (local and fast!)

        ⚡ Blazing fast responses via Groq API (LPU powered)

        🌐 Beautifully wrapped in a Streamlit frontend

    Whether it’s customer support, internal documentation Q&A, or building the next-gen AI assistant — this architecture is plug-and-play and powerful.

    🔥 What excites me most is the blazing performance of Groq — it makes advanced RAG systems finally feel real-time.
